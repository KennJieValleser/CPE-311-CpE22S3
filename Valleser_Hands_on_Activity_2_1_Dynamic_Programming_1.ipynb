        "In solving problems like the Knapsack Problem, we used three different methods which  are  Recursion, Memoization, and Dynamic Programming (DP). Recursion is the simplest because it just keeps breaking the problem into smaller parts, but it’s very slow since it repeats calculations. Memoization improves recursion by saving answers in a table so we don’t have to redo the same work, making it faster. Dynamic Programming (DP) takes a bottom-up approach, filling up a table step by step, which makes it the most efficient since it avoids recursion and extra memory use. In short, recursion is easy but slow, memoization is better but still uses recursion, and DP is the best for big problems because it’s fast and memory-efficient"
